Hello everyone,

We’re excited to welcome you to our new site! Please take some time to familiarize yourself with the various resources and information available here. For TH-242 Students: to ensure you’re up to date, be sure to bookmark the <a href="{{'/curriculum/th242/syllabus_242/' | relative_url }}"> syllabus</a> and <a href="{{ '/curriculum/th242/schedule_242/' | relative_url }}"> schedule</a> for your class, as these are essential for staying on track with your coursework.

Additionally, please note the following:

- The **lab signup sheet** will be posted outside the classroom door. Make sure to sign up for your preferred lab times as soon as possible. 

- For those of you who are majors, the **lesson signup sheets** will be posted outside my office door. Don’t forget to sign up for your lessons to secure your spot.

If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out. We look forward to a great term ahead!

Best regards,  
Professor Dominic Mrakovcich
