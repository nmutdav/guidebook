Hello everyone,

We’re excited to welcome you to our new site! Please take some time to familiarize yourself with the various resources and information available here. For TH-242 Students: to ensure you’re up to date, be sure to bookmark the <a href="{{'/curriculum/th242/syllabus_242/' | relative_url }}"> syllabus</a> and <a href="{{ '/curriculum/th242/schedule_242/' | relative_url }}"> schedule</a> for your class, as these are essential for staying on track with your coursework.

Additionally, please note the following:

- An **office hour sign up sheet** will be posted outside my office door.
If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out. We look forward to a great term ahead!

Best regards,
