# Upper Peninsular Sound Design Institute Proposal

*Updated: August 14, 2024*

## Executive Summary

The Upper Peninsular Sound Design Institute aims to establish a premier hub for sound design education at Northern Michigan University. Over the next 5 years, the institute will offer state-of-the-art facilities, diverse educational programs, and unique opportunities for students and professionals in sound design. Key components include the NMU Sound Lab, various workshops and masterclasses, a comprehensive public website, and significant community engagement through festivals and residencies.

## Introduction

*An all-encompassing NMU program dedicated to Sound Design study and practice.*

This program offers a structured learning environment aimed at launching AV students and others into a collaborative, hands-on space, fostering creativity and career advancement. Despite being housed within the Department of Theatre and Dance, its inclusive nature is highlighted, potentially ushering in a new era of internal collaborations at Northern Michigan University and subsequently external partnerships. Sound Design, essential across various and high industry fields including commercials, video games, and film, will unify disciplines. While starting as a class, I envision its evolution into a comprehensive program, poised to transform NMU into a leading hub for Audio Visual arts with an emphasis on sound design.

## Detailed Program Descriptions

### NMU Sound Lab

The NMU Sound Lab will be equipped with cutting-edge sound design technology, including high-quality recording equipment, editing suites, and software. It will serve as the central hub for all sound design courses and hands-on projects.

### Workshops and Masterclasses

Our workshops and masterclasses will be designed to cater to various skill levels, from beginners to advanced practitioners. They will include hands-on sessions, project-based learning, and expert-led discussions on the latest trends and techniques in sound design.

### Public Website

The Public Website will offer an extensive range of resources, including course information, workshop applications, a digital library of sound design materials, and access to software and manuals. It will serve as a key tool for engagement and learning.

### Residencies and Commissions

The Residency Program will attract top talent to work with our students and faculty, providing them with opportunities for large-scale projects and collaborative work. Commissioned projects will allow local and visiting artists to create custom sound designs, fostering a dynamic and creative environment.
