        <h1>Using Scrum and Kanban in Our Theatre & Dance AV Workflows</h1>
        <p>Scrum and Kanban are well-known project management methodologies commonly used in software development. However, their principles are highly adaptable and can be effectively applied to other fields, including theatre and dance productions. Both methods offer unique benefits for managing audio-visual (AV) workflows, enhancing organization, and improving team collaboration.</p>

        <h2>What is Scrum?</h2>
        <p><strong>Scrum</strong> is an Agile framework designed to help teams work collaboratively on complex projects. It divides work into fixed-length iterations called sprints, typically lasting one to two weeks. During each sprint, teams focus on delivering a set of prioritized tasks, followed by reviews and adjustments to improve processes and outcomes.</p>

        <h2>What is Kanban?</h2>
        <p><strong>Kanban</strong> is a visual workflow management method that emphasizes continuous delivery and efficiency. It uses a Kanban board to track tasks as they move through different stages of completion. By setting limits on work in progress and focusing on smooth task flow, Kanban helps teams manage day-to-day tasks and long-term planning effectively.</p>

        <h2>How Scrum Fits into Our AV Work</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Product Owner:</strong> In our productions, the director or choreographer serves as the product owner. They set the creative vision and prioritize AV tasks, such as media projections or sound cues, to enhance the performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Scrum Master:</strong> The technical director or stage manager acts as the Scrum Master. They ensure smooth operations, address obstacles, and keep the AV team focused on their tasks.</li>
            <li><strong>Development Team:</strong> Our AV team—including sound engineers, media projectionists, and video techs—is responsible for implementing the technical elements of the show. They work together to set up and refine sound, media projections, and video elements during rehearsals.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Scrum Events for Our AV Workflow</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sprint:</strong> Each rehearsal period or tech week acts as a sprint, lasting one to two weeks. During this time, the AV team focuses on completing key tasks such as setting up sound systems or calibrating video projections.</li>
            <li><strong>Sprint Planning:</strong> Before rehearsals, the AV team meets with the director or choreographer to plan the technical elements required, such as configuring audio levels or arranging media content.</li>
            <li><strong>Daily Stand-up:</strong> A brief daily meeting before rehearsal ensures alignment. The AV team discusses progress, any challenges, and prepares for the day’s work.</li>
            <li><strong>Sprint Review & Retrospective:</strong> After a rehearsal phase, the AV team reviews what worked well and what needs improvement. This feedback helps refine the technical setup and ensures readiness for the performance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How Kanban Fits into Our AV Work</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Kanban Board:</strong> A Kanban board helps visualize and manage the flow of general day-to-day tasks and long-term pre-production work. This includes ongoing maintenance, routine setups, and preparation for future productions.</li>
            <li><strong>Work In Progress (WIP) Limits:</strong> Setting WIP limits ensures that the team focuses on completing tasks before taking on new ones, preventing overload and maintaining quality across various projects.</li>
            <li><strong>Continuous Flow:</strong> Kanban emphasizes a steady flow of work, allowing for ongoing adjustments and prioritization as technical needs and creative ideas evolve. This approach supports flexibility and adaptability throughout the production cycle.</li>
            <li><strong>Pull System:</strong> Team members pull tasks from the backlog as they complete current work, enabling a flexible, demand-driven approach. This helps manage ongoing tasks and pre-production activities effectively.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why Use Scrum and Kanban in Our AV Workflow?</h2>
        <div class="highlight">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Scrum and Kanban both offer flexibility, allowing us to adapt to changing creative ideas and technical needs. Scrum's structured sprints are ideal for short-term production phases, while Kanban supports continuous workflow for long-term planning and daily tasks.</li>
                <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Integrating Scrum and Kanban fosters better collaboration within the AV team and with the director or choreographer. This ensures that technical setups align with the artistic vision and supports efficient teamwork.</li>
                <li><strong>Problem-Solving:</strong> Regular Scrum check-ins and Kanban’s visual workflow help identify and address issues quickly, preventing delays and ensuring that all aspects of the AV setup are in place for a successful performance.</li>
            </ul>
