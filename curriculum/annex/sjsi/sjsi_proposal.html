<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>The St John's Sound Initiative is dedicated to field recording the sounds of nature, wildlife, and local customs, highlighting the importance of nature conservation and activism. We make these recordings freely available through an <a href="{{ '/resources/sjsi/sound_library' | relative_url }}">IPFS directory</a>, ensuring that vital information remains accessible without government oversight, corporate censorship, or monetization. Our mission is to inspire awareness and action for the preservation of our environment and culture. Explore our archive and join us in celebrating the beauty of nature while advocating for its protection!</p>
<p>This proposal outlines my plan to capture the rich soundscapes of nature during the Spring Break Marine Biology courses (BI 229 and BI 429) in St. John, U.S. Virgin Islands. The soundscapes will include diverse ecosystems, such as coral reefs, mangroves, seagrass beds, and open waters, with the goal of capturing the natural acoustic environments while documenting important ecological interactions. The recordings will provide valuable resources for educational and conservation purposes.</p>

<h3>Course Overview</h3>
<p>The marine biology course focuses on hands-on experiences in various ecosystems, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Coral Reefs:</strong> Examining the ecological interactions, biodiversity, and effects of climate change.</li>
    <li><strong>Mangroves:</strong> Studying the role of mangroves in habitat creation, species interactions, and coastal protection.</li>
    <li><strong>Seagrass Beds:</strong> Understanding their importance in nutrient cycling, marine life support, and carbon sequestration.</li>
    <li><strong>Open Water:</strong> Observing pelagic species, oceanic conditions, and the impact of human activities.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Project Objectives</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Capture and archive the soundscapes of St. Johnâ€™s diverse marine and coastal environments.</li>
    <li>Document species-specific sounds and environmental cues to understand ecological interactions.</li>
    <li>Assess the anthropogenic impact on natural soundscapes, particularly the effects of human activity such as boats and tourism.</li>
    <li>Develop a collection of educational resources for further research and conservation awareness.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ecosystems and Specific Sounds to Document</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Coral Reefs:</strong> 
        <ul>
            <li>Underwater feeding sounds of species like parrotfish scraping corals, which can indicate the health and activity level of the reef.</li>
            <li>Fish and invertebrate movement, the clicking sounds of shrimp, and ambient reef sounds for biodiversity assessments.</li>
            <li>Sound of currents and waves interacting with the coral structures, highlighting the physical aspects of the reef system.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Mangroves:</strong> 
        <ul>
            <li>Recording bird calls such as the Black-crowned Night Heron and mangrove warblers, providing data on avian diversity.</li>
            <li>Documenting water movement through the roots of mangroves, especially during high tide or storms, to assess their role in coastal protection.</li>
            <li>Insect sounds at dusk and dawn, which indicate ecosystem health, and nocturnal wildlife activity.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Seagrass Beds:</strong> 
        <ul>
            <li>Recording the ambient swaying of seagrass in the current, contributing to studies of underwater habitats and carbon sequestration.</li>
            <li>Sounds of fish interactions with seagrass and substrate to observe ecological dynamics within the beds.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Open Water:</strong> 
        <ul>
            <li>Capturing the sounds of dolphins, whales, or other marine mammals to assess behavioral patterns and communication.</li>
            <li>Background noise from boats and human activities to measure the extent of noise pollution.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Beaches:</strong> 
        <ul>
            <li>Ambient sounds of waves crashing on the shore, wind rustling through palm trees, and bird calls for contextual understanding of coastal dynamics.</li>
            <li>Soundscape transitions between sunrise and sunset, capturing daily rhythms in the coastal environment.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Issues to Address & Risks</h2>
<p>Field recordings in coastal and marine environments pose specific challenges that need to be addressed:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Waterproofing & Environmental Protection:</strong> Ensuring that all recording equipment is adequately waterproofed or protected from humidity and saltwater corrosion.</li>
    <li><strong>Wildlife Disturbance:</strong> Avoiding interference with wildlife during recording sessions to prevent changes in natural behavior.</li>
    <li><strong>Background Noise from Human Activity:</strong> Human-related sounds like boats, construction, or tourism can interfere with capturing natural soundscapes.</li>
    <li><strong>Wind and Weather Conditions:</strong> Wind can heavily distort recordings, particularly in coastal areas, making wind protection essential.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Equipment List and Audio Plan</h2>
<p>The selection of recording equipment is essential to capturing high-quality, stereo, and mono sound in diverse environments. In addition to shotgun microphones, stereo audio equipment will be used for broader soundscapes, while parabolic microphones will focus on distant wildlife sounds.</p>
