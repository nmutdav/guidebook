### **Show Description**

This cult classic humorously pays homage to B movies from the science fiction and horror genres spanning the 1930s to the early 1960s. The plot follows a newly engaged couple who, after being caught in a storm, find themselves at the mansion of a flamboyant transvestite scientist, Dr. Frank-N-Furter. There, they encounter his latest creation, Rockyâ€”a Frankenstein-like figure who is a fully grown, physically perfect muscle man with blonde hair and a tan.
