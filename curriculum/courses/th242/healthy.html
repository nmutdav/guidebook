    <h1>Healthy Practices for Coders</h1>
    <p>Spending long hours coding can lead to eye strain, finger pain, and other discomforts. Adopting healthy practices and exercises can help mitigate these issues and maintain your well-being.</p>

    <h2>1. Exercises to Prevent Eye Strain</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>20-20-20 Rule:</strong> Every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds. This helps reduce eye strain.</li>
        <li><strong>Palming:</strong> Rub your hands together to warm them, then gently cup your palms over your closed eyes. This helps relax your eye muscles.</li>
        <li><strong>Eye Rolling:</strong> Slowly roll your eyes in a circular motion, first clockwise and then counterclockwise. Repeat 5 times in each direction.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Exercises to Prevent Finger and Wrist Pain</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Finger Stretches:</strong> Extend your arm in front of you, spread your fingers wide, and use your other hand to gently pull back on your fingers. Hold for 15-30 seconds.</li>
        <li><strong>Wrist Flexor Stretch:</strong> Extend your arm in front of you with your palm facing up. Use your other hand to gently press down on your fingers, stretching the wrist. Hold for 15-30 seconds.</li>
        <li><strong>Hand Squeeze:</strong> Hold a soft stress ball or similar object and squeeze it gently for 5-10 seconds. Repeat several times.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Healthy Screen Time Practices</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Take Regular Breaks:</strong> Use the Pomodoro Technique or set a timer to take a 5-10 minute break every hour. Move around, stretch, or do something away from the screen.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust Your Screen Settings:</strong> Set your screen to a comfortable brightness level. Use software or built-in settings to reduce blue light exposure, especially in the evening.</li>
        <li><strong>Maintain Proper Ergonomics:</strong> Position your monitor so that the top of the screen is at or just below eye level. Keep your chair and desk at a height that supports good posture.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Additional Tips for Better Eye Health</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Proper Lighting:</strong> Ensure your workspace is well-lit to reduce glare and avoid straining your eyes. Prefer natural light or a desk lamp with adjustable brightness.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust Text Size:</strong> Increase the text size in your editor to reduce eye strain. Most modern IDEs and text editors offer options to change font size and style.</li>
        <li><strong>Stay Hydrated:</strong> Drink plenty of water throughout the day to keep your eyes hydrated and reduce dryness.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Incorporating these practices into your daily routine can help prevent discomfort and maintain your health while coding. Remember to listen to your body and make adjustments as needed.</p>
