    <h1>Introduction to Design Principles</h1>
    <p>Design is the art of crafting experiences through the careful arrangement of visual and auditory elements to achieve specific goals and communicate effectively. This course delves into fundamental design principles with a focus on sound and media. You will explore how to manipulate both audio and visual elements using SuperCollider and Processing. By learning to tweak small code snippets and adjust parameters, you'll gain hands-on experience in creating engaging and dynamic multimedia projects.</p>
