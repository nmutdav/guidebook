# Design Workflow(s)

As a music composer, my approach to design can vary, but here's a specific example of my current workflow for "Alice in Wonderland: An Immersive Experience." Note that this is a personal process and may differ from others.

## Concept

### Pre-Development (R&D)
- **Concept Testing**: Develop and test the concept on a smaller scale to evaluate its viability.
- **Revision**: Regularly revise the concept based on testing feedback over the summer.
- **Peer Review**: Use the revised concept to demonstrate viability during peer review.
- **Preparation**: Ensure the concept is well-developed so you can focus on creating once it's accepted.

### Peer Review
- **Presentation**: Submit the concept proposal to the director and peers. <a href="{{ '/assets/proposals/alice_concept' | relative_url }}">Alice Concept Proposal</a><br>
- **Feedback**: Obtain accept/decline decisions and gather feedback for further development.
