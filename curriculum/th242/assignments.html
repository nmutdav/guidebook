            <h2>Assignment Overview</h2>
            <p>These assignments will guide you through the process of creating a multimedia project by building upon the provided SuperCollider sampler and Processing animation code snippets. Each assignment will help you develop and refine your skills in sound and media design.</p>

        <h2>Template Code Snippets</h2>
        <section>
            <h3>SuperCollider Template Code</h3>
            <pre><code>
// Boot the SuperCollider server
s.boot;

// Define the basic sampler function
(
{
    var freq = 440; // Frequency of the sound
    var amp = 0.5; // Amplitude of the sound
    var buf = Buffer.read(s, "path/to/sample.wav"); // Load the sample
    var snd = PlayBuf.ar(1, buf, BufRateScale.kr(buf), loop: 1, rate: freq, doneAction: 2);

    // Apply envelope to the sound
    var env = EnvGen.kr(Env.perc(0.01, 0.5), doneAction: 2);
    snd = snd * amp * env;

    // Apply basic effects
    snd = FreeVerb.ar(snd, 0.8, 0.9, 0.5); // Reverb effect

    Out.ar(0, snd);
}.play;
)
            </code></pre>

            <h3>Processing Template Code</h3>
            <pre><code>
// Basic Animation with Interactivity in Processing
int circleColor;
float angle = 0;
float radius = 100;
float speed = 0.05;

void setup() {
    size(800, 600);
    circleColor = color(255, 0, 0); // Initial circle color
}

void draw() {
    background(0);
    
    // Update color based on mouse position
    float r = map(mouseX, 0, width, 0, 255);
    float g = map(mouseY, 0, height, 0, 255);
    circleColor = color(r, g, 255 - r);

    // Draw a rotating ellipse
    float x = width / 2 + cos(angle) * radius;
    float y = height / 2 + sin(angle) * radius;
    fill(circleColor);
    noStroke();
    ellipse(x, y, 50, 50);

    // Update angle for rotation
    angle += speed;

    // Draw a line from the center to the circle
    stroke(255);
    line(width / 2, height / 2, x, y);
}

// Adjust rotation speed with arrow keys
void keyPressed() {
    if (keyCode == LEFT) {
        speed -= 0.01;
    } else if (keyCode == RIGHT) {
        speed += 0.01;
    }
