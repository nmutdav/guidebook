    <h1>Assignments</h1>
    <section> <p>In this class, we will use the Processing IDE to explore multimedia projects that integrate audio and visual elements. Each assignment will involve team-based collaboration with rotating members, allowing you to build and refine your skills in creative coding. Individual contributions are required for each assignment to ensure personal accountability. We will use GitHub for collaboration, and each team will be provided with a repository to build upon, host, and showcase their projects.</p> 
    
    </section> <p><strong>Adjustment (09/10/2024):</strong> To better align our projects with sound and media design specifically for theatre, our upcoming assignments will focus on using scripts as inspiration for creating soundscapes and animations. I will provide a repository of public domain scripts along with guidance on which excerpts to use. In class, we will discuss strategies for interpreting these excerpts and how to effectively render sound and animations that complement theatrical productions. This adjustment is intended to help you develop foundational skills in interpreting a script, conceiving of a design, and executing that design, preparing you for future opportunities in designing for theatrical productions. While the assignments will remain similar to before, they will now feature more structure, guidance, and context, framed through the lens of theatre design.</p>
