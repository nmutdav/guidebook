    <h1>Assignments</h1>
    <section>
        <p>In this class, we will use the Processing IDE to explore multimedia projects integrating audio and visual elements. Each assignment involves team-based collaboration with rotating members to help you build and refine your skills in creative coding. Individual contributions are required for each assignment to ensure personal accountability. We will use GitHub for collaboration, and each team will be provided a repository to build upon to host and showcase their projects.</p>
