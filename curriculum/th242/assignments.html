        <h2>Assignment Overview</h2>
        <p>In this class, we will use the Processing IDE exclusively to explore and develop multimedia projects involving both audio and visual elements. Each assignment will guide you through integrating audio and media into your Processing projects, helping you build and refine your skills in creative coding.</p>
