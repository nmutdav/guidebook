    <ul>
        <li><strong>Attendance</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Adjustment:</strong> The class will now focus more on sound and media design for theatre productions. Although assignments remain unchanged, we will be using theatre scripts as the subject matter for these assignments.</li>
        <li><strong>Assigned Short Play Scripts by Chekhov:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Group 1:</strong> "The Proposal"</li>
            <li><strong>Group 2:</strong> "The Wedding"</li>
            <li><strong>Group 3:</strong> "The Bear"</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Students participated in a 45-minute breakout session to read, summarize, and brainstorm design concepts for their assigned scripts.</li>
        <li>Upon returning to class, students created the following table to outline key elements of their scripts:</li>
    </ul>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th></th> <!-- Empty header for row numbers -->
                <th>The Proposal</th>
                <th>The Wedding</th>
                <th>The Bear</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Setting</strong></td>
                <td>Farm, homestead, hunting grounds, meadows, wealth</td>
                <td>Room, large table, orchestra, wealth</td>
                <td>Parlor, wealth</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Atmosphere</strong></td>
                <td>Drama, intensity, comical, arguments</td>
                <td>Chaotic, superficial order contrasted with underlying chaos</td>
                <td>Funny, comical</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Moments</strong></td>
                <td>Five scenes with different arguments, marked by entrances and exits of characters</td>
                <td>Background orchestral music, intense moment at the end, uproar</td>
                <td>Broken chair, swell to emphasize intense moments</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>Based on these broad ideas, we discussed rendering animations and sounds to indicate or emphasize various situations. For instance, using projections of minimalist backdrops with colors or subtle animations to depict locations and create atmospheres, such as a meadow or a fancy parlor. Sound effects and animations can highlight key moments, such as the sound of a breaking chair, background orchestral music, or walla to give the impression of a dining room with people talking.</p>

    <p>We also covered some sound effect terms including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Walla:</strong> Ambient crowd noise, often used to simulate a bustling environment.</li>
        <li><strong>Risers:</strong> Gradually increasing sounds used to build tension or anticipation.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Additional resources mentioned:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>IMSLP:</strong> A source for classical sheet music and recordings.</li>
        <li><strong>FreeSound.org:</strong> For finding sound effects.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Templates are now included in the curriculum to help kickstart your projects, including an essential basic sound effect player.</p>

    <p>For your assignments, it's acceptable to create 3-5 very simplistic Processing IDE sketches that emphasize moments, settings, or atmospheres in your play. The interactivity within these sketches can be as simple as moving the mouse cursor to change animations or colors, and pressing a key to trigger sound effects.</p>
