    <p>Follow these steps to upload your `.pde` sketches and include documentation in your GitHub repository. Proper documentation helps keep track of your work and provides valuable context for your projects.</p>

    <h2>Important Note on GitHub</h2>
    <p>GitHub is a public platform, so while only team members can commit to their respective repositories, please:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>**Avoid sharing any personal or sensitive information** in your commits or files.</li>
        <li>**Maintain proper and school-appropriate etiquette** when using the platform. Always be respectful and professional in your interactions and content.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>1. Open GitHub Desktop</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Launch <a href="https://desktop.github.com" target="_blank">GitHub Desktop</a>.</li>
        <li>Ensure you are signed in with your GitHub account.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Clone Your Repository (If Not Already Done)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>In GitHub Desktop, go to <strong>File</strong> > <strong>Clone repository</strong>.</li>
        <li>Select the repository you have been provided (e.g., "Group 1" or "Group 2").</li>
        <li>Choose a local path on your computer where the repository will be saved.</li>
        <li>Click <strong>Clone</strong> to download the repository to your computer.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Add Your `.pde` Sketches</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Open the folder where you cloned your repository on your computer.</li>
        <li>Copy your `.pde` sketches into this folder.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Create Documentation Files</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>In the same repository folder, create a new file named <strong>README.md</strong> for Markdown or <strong>README.txt</strong> for plain text.</li>
        <li>Include your project documentation in this file. This can include:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Your reflections on the project</li>
            <li>Proposals or plans for future work</li>
            <li>Instructions for running or using the sketches</li>
        </ul>
        <li>For Markdown files, you can use simple formatting like:</li>
        <pre>
# Project Title
## Reflections
Describe your reflections here.

## Proposals
Outline your proposals or future plans here.

## Instructions
Provide instructions on how to use or run the sketches here.
        </pre>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Commit Your Changes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Return to GitHub Desktop. You should see your `.pde` files and `README` file listed under the <strong>Changes</strong> tab.</li>
        <li>Write a brief commit message describing your changes (e.g., "Added initial sketches and documentation").</li>
        <li>Click <strong>Commit to main</strong> to save your changes locally.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Push Your Changes to GitHub</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>After committing your changes, click on <strong>Push origin</strong> in GitHub Desktop. This uploads your local commits to the GitHub repository.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Verify Your Upload</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Go to your repository on GitHub's website.</li>
        <li>Ensure your `.pde` sketches and `README` file are visible in the repository files.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Additional Tips</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Keep your documentation clear and concise to provide valuable context for your work.</li>
        <li>Only make changes to the files you need to work on. Avoid creating or switching branches to keep things simple.</li>
        <li>If you encounter any issues, ask for help or refer to the GitHub documentation.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>By following these steps, you'll be able to upload and manage your sketches and documentation effectively. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out!</p>
