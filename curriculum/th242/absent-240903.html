        <p><strong>Class Time:</strong> 8:00 AM - 9:40 AM</p>
        <p>Although I will not be attending class on September 3, 2024, please use the class time to work with your group on the breakout session activities. Follow these instructions to complete and submit your report:</p>
        
        <h2>Instructions for Completing and Submitting Your Report</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1. Meet with Your Group:</strong> During the class period (8:00 AM - 9:40 AM), gather with your group. Please spend no more than ten minutes to find a suitable workspace. You may work outside on the quad if desired. Discuss your tasks related to the assignment, collaborate on your project, and address any issues that arise.</li>
            <li><strong>2. Draft Your Report:</strong> Prepare a brief Markdown report including:
                <ul>
                    <li>A summary of your group's work, including how the audio clip influenced your visual design.</li>
                    <li>Challenges faced during the project and how they were addressed.</li>
                    <li>Next steps or action items for completing the assignment.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>3. Upload the Report to GitHub:</strong> 
                <ul>
                    <li>Log in to your group's GitHub repository.</li>
                    <li>Navigate to the appropriate folder (e.g., `reports/`).</li>
                    <li>Create a new file named `brief_report.md`.</li>
                    <li>Paste your Markdown report into this file.</li>
                    <li>Commit the file with a message such as "Added report for September 3, 2024 breakout session."</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>4. Verify Submission:</strong> Check the repository to ensure the report is uploaded correctly and visible.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you encounter any issues with GitHub or need assistance, reach out to your group members. Make sure the report is submitted by the end of the class period.</p>
