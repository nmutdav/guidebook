5. **Organize Cues**:
   - Drag and drop cues within the cue list to reorder them as desired.

6. **Preview the Audio Cue**:
   - Click the `Go` button (play icon) in the inspector window to preview the audio cue with the fade effects.
   - Ensure the fade-in and fade-out transitions sound smooth and as expected.

7. **Deliver**:
   - **Save Your Workspace**:
     - Go to `File` > `Save` to ensure all your changes are saved.
   - **Create a .zip File**:
     - Navigate to your project folder: `Documents` > `TH-242_workbook` > `Assignments` > `[YYMMDD] [your name] - qlab_tutorial_01`.
     - Control-click (right-click) on the workspace file and select `Compress`. A `.zip` file will appear.
   - **Email Your Assignment**:
     - Email the `.zip` file to your [course instructor](mailto:dmrakovc@nmu.edu):

### Tutorial 3: Navigating Freesound.org and Storing Sample Packs in the Samples Folder

#### **Objective**: Learn how to navigate Freesound.org, download and store sample packs in the `Samples` folder within the `TH-242_workbook` directory, and use the terminal to preview all sample files.

### Steps:

1. **Navigate to Freesound.org**:
   - Open your web browser and go to [Freesound.org](https://freesound.org/).

2. **Create a Freesound Account (if you don't have one)**:
   - Click **Sign Up** in the top right corner.
   - Complete the registration process and verify your email if required.

3. **Search for Sample Packs**:
   - Use the search bar to enter relevant keywords (e.g., "drum loops," "ambient sounds").
   - Press **Enter** or click the search icon.

4. **Filter and Select Sample Packs**:
   - Apply filters to narrow your search by **Type**, **Duration**, and **License**.
   - Click on a sample pack to view details.

5. **Download the Sample Pack**:
   - Click **Download** on the sample pack page.
   - Save the file to a temporary location.

6. **Extract the Sample Pack**:
   - Locate the downloaded `.zip` file.
   - Right-click and choose **Extract** or use a file extraction tool.

7. **Store the Sample Pack in the Correct Directory**:
   - Navigate to the `TH-242_workbook` directory:
     - Open Finder and go to `Documents` > `TH-242_workbook` > `Samples`.
   - Copy or move the extracted files into the `Samples` folder. Create a subfolder named after the sample pack (e.g., `Drum Loops Pack`).

8. **Preview All Sample Files Using Terminal**:
   To play all sample files in the terminal, follow these steps:

   - **Open Terminal**:
     - On macOS, open the Terminal app.

   - **Navigate to the Samples Directory**:
     ```bash
     cd ~/Documents/TH-242_workbook/Samples
     ```

   - **List Files**:
     ```bash
     ls
     ```

   - **Play Sample Files**:
     Use `afplay` to play each sample file. Replace `filename` with the actual file names:
     ```bash
     afplay filename.wav
     ```

     For example, to play `drum_loop1.wav`, `drum_loop2.wav`, and `ambient_sound.wav`:
     ```bash
     afplay drum_loop1.wav
     afplay drum_loop2.wav
     afplay ambient_sound.wav
     ```

     To play all `.wav` files, create a script:

     - Create a script file named `play_samples.sh`:
       ```bash
       touch play_samples.sh
       chmod +x play_samples.sh
       ```

     - Edit the script:
       ```bash
       nano play_samples.sh
       ```
       Add the following content:
       ```bash
       #!/bin/bash
       for file in *.wav; do
         echo "Playing $file"
         afplay "$file"
       done
       ```

     - Save and run the script:
       ```bash
       ./play_samples.sh
       ```

9. **Update Your QLab Project**:
   - Open QLab and ensure the new sample files are accessible by navigating to `Documents` > `TH-242_workbook` > `Samples`.

10. **Deliver Your Work**:
    - **Save Your Workspace**:
      - Go to `File` > `Save` in QLab.

    - **Create a .zip File**:
      - Navigate to `Documents` > `TH-242_workbook` > `Assignments` > `[YYMMDD] [your name] - qlab_tutorial_03`.
      - Control-click (right-click) on the workspace file and select `Compress`. A `.zip` file will appear.

    - **Email Your Assignment**:
      - **Subject**: `[YYMMDD] [your name] - qlab_tutorial_03`
      - **Body**: "See File Attached -- [Your Name]"
      - Attach the `.zip` file and send.
