### 1. Preparation
1. **Review Script and Actor List**:
   - Identify which actors need lavalier microphones and review their scenes.
2. **Select Microphones**:
   - Choose the appropriate lavalier microphones and wireless systems based on the actor’s needs and the performance environment.

### 2. Attaching Lavalier Microphones
1. **Setup Wireless System**:
   - Ensure that the wireless transmitters and receivers are charged and paired. Test frequencies to avoid interference.
2. **Prepare Lavalier Microphones**:
   - Attach the microphones to the clips or accessories. Make sure they are securely attached and functional.
3. **Attach to Actors**:
   - Carefully clip the lavalier microphones to the actors’ clothing. Common placements include:
     - **For Male Actors**: Attach the mic near the collar or chest area, hidden under clothing.
     - **For Female Actors**: Clip the mic to the upper torso or inside a neckline, ensuring it is discreet.
   - Use mic windshields if necessary to reduce noise from clothing movement or breath.

### 3. Testing and Adjustment
1. **Sound Check**:
   - Conduct a sound check with the actor to ensure proper microphone placement and sound quality.
2. **Adjust Levels**:
   - Set and adjust the audio levels on the wireless transmitters and receivers. Ensure clear audio without distortion or interference.
3. **Final Check**:
   - Verify that the microphone is securely attached and not visible or prone to shifting during performance.

## Workflow 4.1.2: Miking a 4-Piece Drum Kit

Learning to mic a drum kit is a great introduction to various microphone types and placements.

### Suggested Equipment
- **Drum Kit**: With throne, rug, riser, drumsticks
- **Microphones with Respective Clips**:
  - **Kick**: Large-diaphragm dynamic mic (e.g., Shure Beta 52A)
  - **Snare**: Standard dynamic mic (e.g., Shure SM57)
  - **Toms**: Small Tom Mics (e.g., Sennheiser e604) x2
  - **Overheads**: Condenser Mics (e.g., AKG C1000) x2
  - **Hi-Hat**: Pencil Condenser Mic (e.g., Sennheiser e614)
- **Microphone Stands**:
  - Short kick stand x1
  - Tall boom stand x3-4
- **XLR Cables**: Medium Length 15-25 ft x7
- **8-Channel XLR Snake**

### 1. Setup

1. **Set Up Drum Kit and Tune**:
   - Assemble and tune the drum kit for optimal sound quality.
2. **Collect Equipment**:
   - Gather all necessary microphones, stands, cables, and the XLR snake.
3. **Setup Mic Stands and Mics**:
   - Position the microphone stands and attach the microphones.
4. **Plug in XLR Cables**:
   - Route the XLR cables into the snake and keep cable runs tidy. Coil excess cables at the base of their respective mic stands to avoid buildup.
   - **Channel 1**: Kick Drum
   - **Channel 2**: Snare Drum
   - **Channel 3 & 4**: Toms
   - **Channel 5 & 6**: Overheads
   - **Channel 7**: Hi-Hat

### 2. Microphone Placement

- **Kick Drum**:
  - Place the mic just inside or outside the hole of the kick drum, aimed at the beater impact point.
- **Snare Drum**:
  - Position the mic 1-2 inches above the drumhead, pointing towards the center.
- **Toms**:
  - Place the mic close to the rim of the tom, aimed at the center of the drumhead.
- **Overheads**:
  - Position the mics in an XY or spaced pair configuration above the drum kit, around 3-4 feet high.

### 3. Test and Balance

1. **Testing**:
   - If available, have the drummer play the kit and adjust microphone positions and gain levels on the console. Otherwise, have a member of the TDAV Crew test the kit while the engineer adjusts mix settings. (Refer to Workflow 3.1.3)
