   - Ensure that wireless transmitters and receivers are charged and paired. Test frequencies to avoid interference.
2. **Prepare Lavalier Microphones:**
   - Attach microphones to clips or accessories, ensuring they are functional and ready for use.
3. **Clip to Actors:**
   - Securely attach the lavalier microphones to actors’ clothing. Common placements include:
     - **For Male Actors:** Near the collar or chest area, hidden under clothing.
     - **For Female Actors:** Inside the neckline or upper torso area, ensuring discretion.
   - Use mic windshields if needed to reduce noise from clothing movement or breath.

#### `Setup`
1. **Set Up Drum Kit and Tune:**
   - Assemble and tune the drum kit to ensure optimal sound quality.
2. **Collect Equipment:**
   - Gather microphones, stands, cables, and the XLR snake.
3. **Setup Mic Stands and Mics:**
