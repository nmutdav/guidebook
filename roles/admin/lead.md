## Workflow 1.2.2: Crew Reports

End-of-day reports should be sent via email to the entire NMU TDAV team. Use a table format for clarity, making it easy to summarize and review. Technical Directors will provide detailed reports at the end of rehearsals and performances, so crew reports should focus on TDAV needs.

*Example:*

#### NMU TDAV Crew – End of Day Report `[YYMMDD]`

| **Field**            | **Details**   |
|----------------------|---------------|
| **Date:**            |               |
| **Time:**            |               |
| **Crew:**            |               |

## Workflow 1.2.3: Inventory

Include details for items requiring login credentials, IP addresses, etc., to facilitate access for crew members. Ensure the inventory is clear and descriptive enough for understanding system specs when planning events. Exercise caution with sensitive information when sharing inventories.
