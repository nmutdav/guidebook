## Workflow 1.2.2: Crew Reports

Reports should be sent via email at the end of each scheduled work call to the entire NMU TDAV team. Format reports in a table for clarity and brevity, making it easy for anyone to summarize from a glance. Technical Directors will provide more detailed reports at the end of rehearsals and performances, so crew reports should focus on TDAV needs.

*Example:*

#### NMU TDAV Crew â€“ End of Day Report `[YYMMDD]`

| **Field**            | **Details**   |
|----------------------|---------------|
| **Date:**            |               |
| **Time:**            |               |
| **Crew:**            |               |
| **Work Assigned:**   |               |

## Workflow 1.2.3: Inventory

Conduct a large-scale inventory once per semester, updating the list as items are added or removed. Include details for items requiring login credentials, IP addresses, etc., so crew members can access them without issues. Ensure the inventory is simple yet descriptive enough for understanding system specs when planning events. Be cautious with sensitive information when sharing inventories with external parties.

*Example:*

#### NMU TDAV Inventory
Updated: `YYMMDD`

| **Label**    | **Item**       | **Quantity** | **Location** | **Serial**   | **IP**   | **Login**   |
