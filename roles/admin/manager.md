   - Click the "Upload" button (a cloud icon with an arrow) to upload files from your computer. You can also drag and drop files.

3. **Organize and Review Files:**
   - After uploading, Frame.io will process the files. Once processing is complete, organize them into folders if needed.
   - Preview each asset to ensure correct upload and playback. This helps identify any issues early.

4. **Set Permissions and Access:**

6. **Share the Files with Your Client:**
   - Share the assets via direct links within Frame.io or use the generated review link.
   - Paste the links into an email or communication tool to provide access.

7. **Receive Feedback and Collaborate:**
   - Clients can leave comments, annotations, and mark specific sections on the video timeline for detailed feedback.
   - Monitor and review client feedback to make necessary adjustments to the assets.

8. **Finalize and Download (If Necessary):**
   - Once feedback is incorporated and the assets are approved, finalize them.
   - Make the final copies available for download if required by the client.

9. **Close Out the Project:**
   - After client download and final approval, consider the project closed.
   - Archive the project on Frame.io or organize files according to internal processes for future reference.

10. **Maintain Communication:**
    - Keep clear and ongoing communication with your client through Frame.io or other channels to ensure a smooth workflow and address any questions or concerns.
