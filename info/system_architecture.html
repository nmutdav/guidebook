            <h2>Components Overview</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>GuideBook</strong></li>
                    A publicly accessible static website featuring the program curriculum and support pages.
                    The support pages allow both internal and external clients to submit work order requests,
                    which are directed to the Crew Workbook. This site is open source, free to use, and does not
                    handle sensitive data.<p>

                <li><strong>Workbook</strong></li>
                    A private digital spreadsheet used to manage crew tasks, call times, inventory, and purchasing.
                    This document is shared among team members for operational coordination.<p>
                
                <li><strong>Cloud Drive</strong></li>
                    A private NAS (Network Attached Storage) that provides the crew with access to show files.
                    This drive facilitates the sharing of essential documents and media related to productions.<p>
                
                <li><strong>Hard Disk Drive</strong></li>
                    A securely stored drive dedicated to large files, primarily video recordings. Access is
                    restricted and requires a request through the support page, granting temporary access via
                    a file drop.<p>
                
                <li><strong>YouTube</strong></li>
                    Our platform for streaming department videos, including performances. This channel is used
                    to share video content with a wider audience.<p>
                
                <li><strong>Social Media</strong></li>
                    We are in the process of establishing social media accounts, including a dedicated Instagram
                    page for promotional materials. The press team, under the TDAV crew, will work with the
                    marketing manager for content and outreach.<p>
                
                <li><strong>Github</strong></li>
                    The repository for our curriculum code files. Some access is restricted to students and approved
                    contributors, such as assignment deliverables. The public can clone and fork the open-source curriculum, but contributors
                    must be granted permission to make pull requests.<p>
