    <h1>Media Storage Protocol</h1>
    
    <div class="note">
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> To ensure proper media usage, please do not share any files with anyone outside of the <strong>TDAV Media team</strong>. This is crucial for protecting against copyright issues and ensuring a respectful portrayal of our students and university.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Media Storage Location(s)</h2>
    <p>Media will be stored in the following locations:
        <ol>
            <li>Master SSD in the Media Supervisor's Office</li>
            <li>Cloned SSD in the Box Office</li>
            <li>InterPlanetaryFileSystem or similar for Backup Archive.<a href="{{ '/support/ipfs_about' | relative_url }}">Read More</a>
        </ol>
        <p>Please do not remove these drives, but rather keep them secured in their locations preferably k-locked, and pull files from them with your work computer instead.</p>
Media will no longer be stored on cloud Drives (ie. google drive) in order to regulate usage and keep costs down.</p>
<p>For now, smaller items such as rehearsal/seminar recordings should be stored locally on faculty/staff computers, and can be shared either using a thumb drive. By the next semester, I plan to migrate our media sharing entirely to a secure IPFS network (or similar).</p>
<p> Also as a note, <strong>do not</strong>upload any media to NMU's Canto repository unless granted explicit permission.</p>   
<h2>File Organization Instructions</h2>
    <p>All files are stored in the master folder titled <strong>TDAV MEDIA DRIVE</strong>. Within this folder, create subfolders for each production, labeled by the show title.</p>

    <h2>File Naming Convention</h2>
    <p>When saving files, adhere to the following format:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Date:</strong> Use <code>YYMMDD</code> format.</li>
        <li><strong>Show Title:</strong> Include the title of the show.</li>
        <li><strong>File Type:</strong> Indicate the type of file with the following suffixes:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>_RAW</strong> for raw files (photos or videos)</li>
                <li><strong>_EDIT</strong> for edited projects</li>
                <li><strong>_DELIVER</strong> for deliverables</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>TRASHME Folder</h2>
    <p>Use the <strong>TRASHME</strong> folder for items scheduled for deletion:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Label this folder as <strong>TRASHME YYMMDD</strong>.</li>
        <li>Items will be kept until the specified date for regular cleanup.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Example File Names</h2>
    <div class="example">
        <p>Here are some examples of properly formatted file names:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>241101 Jekyll and Hyde - Photo_RAW</code></li>
            <li><code>241101 Les Miserables - Video_DELIVER</code></li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Following these instructions carefully will ensure proper organization and easy access for our media team. Thank you for your cooperation!</p>
