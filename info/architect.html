<h1>System Architecture</h1>

    <ol>    
        <li><strong>GuideBook</strong></li>
        A publicly accessible static site complete with the program curriculum and support pages. The support pages allow internal and external clients to put in work order requests which gets fed to the Crew Workbook. This site is public, free, and open source, and does not store or share any sensitive data.
        <li><strong>Workbook</strong></li>
        A privately shared digital spreadsheet, which contains crew tasks, call-times, inventory, and purchasing.
        <li><strong>Cloud Drive</strong></li>
        A Privately shared NAS, which allows show files to be accessed by the crew.
        <li><strong>Hard Disk Drive</strong></li>
        A securely placed drive, this is where we will store large files, primarily our video recordings. These files can only be accessed by placing a request on the support page, in which a temporary file drop will be granted.
        <li><strong>YouTube</strong></li>
        This is where we will stream our department videos including performances
        <li><strong>Social Media</strong></li>
        This is still in the works, but I imagine we will have a dedicated instagram page with our promotional materials. In which TDAV crew primarily, the press team will be in contact with the marketing manager.
        <li><strong>Github</strong></li>
        This is where we will store our code files for curriculum. Students have privately granted access to curriculum code files. The public website is freely available to clone and fork, as the curriculum is open-source. Web page contributors must be granted permission to make any pull requests.
