# Standards of Practice
## Communication
Effective communication is vital for the successful execution of duties. All interactions must be prompt and professional. While students may request to keep contact information private, it is preferable for the Sound & Media Supervisor and Crew Lead to have everyone’s contact details.

As crew sizes grow and roles become more specialized, communication should be localized and focused. For instance, a Stage Hand setting up microphones should follow instructions from the Audio Technician rather than seeking guidance from unrelated roles like the Press Manager. [The TDAV Crew diagram](../assets/tdav_crew.jpg) illustrates this communication flow.

- **Verbal** – Direct, face-to-face communication.
- **Phone Call/Text Message** – Ideal for immediate updates or checking on team members.
- **Clear Com** – Wireless intercom used during productions on designated RF channels.
- **Group Instant Message** [Whats.app](https://www.whatsapp.com/) – For team-wide questions and administrative communication. Available on mobile and computer.
- **University Email** – For schedules, reports, and course materials. Responses may not be immediate. 
  - **Priorities List-Serv:** Regular group emails with priority lists based on crew duties.

## Ladder Safety Training
All students must complete the following online courses from the American Ladder Institute's [Safety Training](https://www.laddersafetytraining.org) and submit completion certificates by the due date:
1. Step Ladder Safety Training
2. Single Ladders & Extension Ladders
3. Articulated Ladders
4. Mobile Ladder Stands & Mobile Ladder Stand Platforms

*Additionally, TDAV crew should complete Fall Protection Class and Mobile Lift Training provided by the university.*

## Scheduled Breaks
Breaks are essential for maintaining health and productivity. Regular breaks prevent fatigue and reduce stress. Suggested breaks:
- **Union Rules:**
  - 2 Hours Work = 10-minute break
  - 5 Hours Work = 30-minute break
- **Suggestion:**
  - 2 Hours Work = 20-minute break
  - 5 Hours Work = 1-hour break

**Double Commuting**: Consider commute time when scheduling. Crew members commuting 30 minutes or more should ideally either go home or stay for the entire day.

## Crew Software
Standardizing software ensures ease of teaching, communication, and troubleshooting. Administrators will remind crew to keep software updated and inform clients of the software and versions used. Most software, except QLab, is compatible across MacOS, Linux, Windows, and Ubuntu. Preference is given to free and/or open-source software.

## Naming Folders and Files
- **Master Folder**: `[YYMMDD] NMU [Event]`
  - Example: `240803 NMU Grease`
- **Subfolder**: `[00] [Area]`
  - Examples: `01 Audio`, `02 Media`, `03 Video`
- **RAW Recording Files**: `[YYMMDD] NMU [Event]_RAW.[ext]`
  - Example: `240803 NMU Grease_RAW.mp4`
- **Edited Recording Files**: `[YYMMDD] NMU [Event]_MAS.[ext]`
  - Example: `240803 NMU Grease_MAS.mp4`

## Recording Formats
- **Audio**:
  - Format: WAV
  - Sample Rate: 48 kHz
  - Bit Depth: 24-bit
- **Video**:
  - Format: MP4, MOV
  - Resolution: 1920 x 1080
  - Frame Rate: 30 or 60 FPS
- **Photo**:
  - *Capture*: RAW (e.g., NEF, CR2, BRAW), Color Space: Standard RGB
  - *Deliverables*: JPEG, Ratio: 3:2 or 2:3

## Live Stream Settings
1. Resolution: 1920 x 1080 (1080p)
2. Frame Rate: 30 or 60 FPS
3. Video Bitrate: 4500 – 6000 kbps
4. Encoder: NVENC (GPU)
5. Audio Bitrate: 128 or 192 kbps
6. Audio Sample Rate: 48 kHz

## Labeling Equipment
Clear labeling facilitates efficient operation and troubleshooting. Labels should be durable and placed consistently.

### General Hardware
1. **Label Format**: Category, Identifier, Location/Use (e.g., `MIC-01-FRT` for a microphone).
2. **Label Placement**: Visible locations on equipment and racks.
3. **Labeling Materials**: Durable adhesive labels.

### Ethernet Cables
1. **Label Format**: Site/Building, Rack/Panel, Port Number, Cable Identifier.
2. **Label Placement**: Both cable ends, patch panels, and switches.
3. **Labeling Materials**: Durable adhesive labels designed for network cables.

### Audio Cables
1. **Label Format**: Prefix, Cable Number, Source/Destination, Port/Channel.
2. **Label Placement**: Both cable ends and cable sleeves.
3. **Labeling Materials**: Durable adhesive labels or cable tags.

## Digital Storage Infrastructure
A standardized folder structure ensures files are easily accessible and organized.
