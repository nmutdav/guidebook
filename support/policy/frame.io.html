        <strong>Important:</strong>
        <p>We will be using Frame.io to share photo and video files within our Theatre and Dance Department. Each event will have its own master folder with a subfolder for photos and videos. Within those, we will have three subfolders: RAW, EDITS, and DELIVERABLES to keep our files organized.</p>
        <p>Please do not share files outside of our department. If someone would like access to photos or videos from a show, they must request it through our media access form to ensure proper usage and compliance with copyright policies. This is to protect everyone from legal issues related to posting and distributing media without proper authorization.</p>
