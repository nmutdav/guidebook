            <h1>Northern Michigan University<br>Theatrical Production Media Usage Policy</h1>
            <p>Welcome to the Northern Michigan University Theatrical Production Media Policy. This document outlines the guidelines for the use of recordings and photographs from our theatrical productions. Please read and adhere to the following policy to ensure compliance with our standards and respect for intellectual property rights and privacy.</p>

            <h2>Policy Overview</h2>
            <p>The recordings (audio and video) and photographs of our theatrical productions are intended for academic purposes and audition use only. Any other use, including commercial or promotional purposes, is strictly prohibited. This includes, but is not limited to, posting on social media, public sharing, and any form of commercial distribution.</p>

            <h2>Guidelines for Use</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Academic Use:</strong> Media may be used for educational purposes within the scope of coursework or academic projects. This includes classroom presentations, research, and critique assignments.</li>
                <li><strong>Audition Use:</strong> Media may be utilized by students for audition purposes, such as preparing or submitting audition materials for external opportunities.</li>
                <li><strong>Prohibited Uses:</strong> Media may not be used for any commercial, promotional, or personal gain. This includes posting videos on social media platforms (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, TikTok) and sharing with third parties.</li>
                <li><strong>Photo Usage:</strong> Students may use photographs for personal profiles on social media, provided the use is respectful and does not misrepresent the production. All other media (audio and video) must not be posted publicly.</li>
                <li><strong>Privacy and Intellectual Property:</strong> Respect the privacy of individuals and the intellectual property rights of the institution. Media should not be altered or edited in any way that misrepresents the original production.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Copyright Considerations</h2>
            <p>Even short clips (10 seconds or less) may be subject to copyright laws. While some uses may fall under "fair use," this is not guaranteed. Factors such as the purpose, nature, amount, and market effect are considered. Always seek permission from the copyright owner or use royalty-free content to avoid potential issues.</p>

            <h2>Liability</h2>
            <p>Northern Michigan University is not liable for any copyright violations by students who post or share copyrighted materials without proper authorization. Students are responsible for understanding and complying with copyright laws and this policy.</p>

            <h2>Approval for Receiving Media</h2>
            <p>Before receiving any recordings or photographs from a theatrical production, students must obtain written approval from the Sound & Media Supervisor. This process ensures the respectful use of media and helps avoid copyright issues. The approval process includes the following steps:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Request Submission:</strong> Submit a formal request to the Sound & Media Supervisor detailing the intended use of the media.</li>
                <li><strong>Review and Approval:</strong> Await written approval from the relevant authority. Approval will be granted based on adherence to the policy guidelines and the proposed use.</li>
                <li><strong>Compliance:</strong> Use the media only as specified in the approved request. Any deviation from the approved use must be re-submitted for approval.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Enforcement</h2>
            <p>Violations of this policy may result in disciplinary action as determined by the institutionâ€™s regulations. This may include, but is not limited to, revocation of media access privileges and other consequences as deemed appropriate.</p>

            <h2>Contact Information</h2>
            <p>For any questions regarding this policy or to report violations, please contact Dominic Mrakovcich at <a href="mailto:dmrakovc@nmu.edu">dmrakovc@nmu.edu</a>.</p>
