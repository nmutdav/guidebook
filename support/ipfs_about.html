    <h1>Using IPFS as a University Backup Drive</h1>
    <p>Welcome to this tutorial on using IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) as a backup drive for your university projects. IPFS is a decentralized storage network that allows you to store and share files across the globe.</p>

    <h2 id="what-is-ipfs">What is IPFS?</h2>
    <p>IPFS is a peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol designed to make the web faster, safer, and more open. Instead of relying on a centralized server, IPFS uses a distributed network to store and retrieve files. Each file is identified by its content, making it easy to share and retrieve. Here’s how it works:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Upload the File:</strong> You select a file on your computer and add it to IPFS.</li>
        <li><strong>Chunking:</strong> The file is broken into smaller pieces, called blocks.</li>
        <li><strong>Hashing:</strong> Each block gets a unique ID (CID) based on its content.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> The blocks are stored on your local IPFS node.</li>
        <li><strong>Distributed Network:</strong> The blocks are shared with other nodes in the IPFS network.</li>
        <li><strong>Content Addressing:</strong> You can access the file using its CID, no matter where it's stored.</li>
        <li><strong>Persistence:</strong> As long as at least one node has the file, it remains available on IPFS.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If you have multiple nodes (like two computers), and one goes offline, you can still retrieve your files from the other node, as long as they were shared between them.</p>
    <p> I highly recommend that before, importing files to IPFS, that you encypt them. Here is a tutorial for this: <a href="{{ '/support/gpg_howto' | relative_url }}">How to Encrypt Files</a></p>
    <h2 id="install-ipfs">Installing IPFS on Your Desktop</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Visit the <a href="https://ipfs.io/#install" target="_blank">IPFS Installation Page</a>.</li>
        <li>Choose the appropriate version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).</li>
        <li>Follow the installation instructions provided on the page.</li>
        <li>After installation, open your terminal or command prompt.</li>
        <li>Run the following command to initialize IPFS:</li>
        <pre><code>ipfs init</code></pre>
        <li>Start the IPFS daemon by running:</li>
        <pre><code>ipfs daemon</code></pre>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="add-files">Adding Files to IPFS</h2>
    <p>To add files to IPFS, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Open your terminal or command prompt.</li>
        <li>Navigate to the directory containing the files you want to back up.</li>
        <li>Add a file to IPFS using the command:</li>
        <pre><code>ipfs add yourfile.ext</code></pre>
        <li>IPFS will return a unique hash (CID) for your file. This hash is how your file is identified on the IPFS network.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="retrieve-files">Retrieving Files from IPFS</h2>
    <p>To retrieve your files from IPFS, use the following command:</p>
    <pre><code>ipfs cat yourfileCID</code></pre>
    <p>You can also view the file in a web browser by visiting:</p>
    <pre><code>https://ipfs.io/ipfs/yourfileCID</code></pre>

    <h2 id="benefits-of-more-users">Benefits of More Users in IPFS</h2>
    <p>Encouraging more users within a university to adopt IPFS offers several advantages:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Increased Redundancy:</strong> More users mean that files are replicated across multiple nodes, enhancing availability and resilience.</li>
        <li><strong>Improved Accessibility:</strong> A larger network results in faster retrieval times as files can be accessed from various locations.</li>
        <li><strong>Decentralized Storage:</strong> Spreading storage across many users reduces reliance on central servers, minimizing the risk of data loss.</li>
        <li><strong>Collaborative Projects:</strong> Students can easily share files with peers, streamlining group work through unique IPFS hashes.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduced Bandwidth Costs:</strong> Distributed hosting decreases the burden on any single user’s bandwidth, improving performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Incentivizing Participation:</strong> Users may benefit from faster access to shared resources, encouraging more participation.</li>
        <li><strong>Enhanced Security:</strong> Files are identified by content hashes, reducing the risk of unauthorized changes.</li>
        <li><strong>Facilitated Long-term Access:</strong> Multiple users storing the same content ensures long-term availability of important files.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="best-practices">Best Practices</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Regularly back up your important files to IPFS.</li>
        <li>Share the CID with peers for collaborative projects.</li>
        <li>Consider using IPFS in conjunction with other backup solutions.</li>
        <li>Keep your IPFS node running to ensure your files are accessible.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Using IPFS as a backup drive can provide a reliable and decentralized way to store your university projects. With just a few commands, you can ensure your important files are safe and accessible anytime, anywhere.</p>
