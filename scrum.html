        <h1>Using Scrum in Our Theatre & Dance AV Workflows</h1>
        <p>Scrum is a flexible project management method that focuses on teamwork and adaptability. While it's often used in software development, it works great for organizing technical work in theatre and dance productions, especially for our audio-visual (AV) needs. Whether we’re setting up lighting, sound, or video, Scrum helps break down tasks into manageable steps and fosters collaboration.</p>

        <h2>How Scrum Fits into Our AV Work</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Product Owner:</strong> In our productions, the director or choreographer is the product owner. They set the creative vision and help prioritize AV tasks like lighting cues or video projections to enhance the performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Scrum Master:</strong> The technical director or stage manager takes on the Scrum Master role. They ensure that everything runs smoothly, remove any obstacles for the team, and keep everyone focused on the AV work.</li>
            <li><strong>Development Team:</strong> Our AV team (sound, lighting, and video techs) is responsible for delivering the technical elements of the show. They work together to set up and fine-tune the lighting, sound, and video through rehearsals.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Scrum Events for Our AV Workflow</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sprint:</strong> Each rehearsal period or tech week is like a sprint, lasting one to two weeks. During this time, our AV team focuses on completing key tasks, such as setting up lights or synchronizing sound with the performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Sprint Planning:</strong> Before rehearsals, the AV team meets with the director or choreographer to plan the technical elements that need to be done—whether it’s programming lighting cues or setting up audio.</li>
            <li><strong>Daily Stand-up:</strong> A short daily meeting before rehearsal helps everyone stay aligned. The AV team discusses progress, any challenges, and prepares for the day's work.</li>
            <li><strong>Sprint Review & Retrospective:</strong> After a rehearsal phase, the AV team reviews what worked well and what needs improvement. This feedback helps us perfect the technical setup and ensure readiness for the performance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why Use Scrum in Our AV Workflow?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Since creative ideas and technical needs often change during rehearsals, Scrum lets us adapt quickly.</li>
            <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> By working closely with the director, choreographer, and each other, our AV team ensures the technical setup supports the artistic vision.</li>
            <li><strong>Problem-solving:</strong> Regular check-ins allow us to spot and fix issues quickly, so nothing falls behind before opening night.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>By using Scrum in our theatre and dance AV workflow, we can stay organized, improve collaboration, and deliver the best possible performance.</p>
