        <h1>Using Scrum and Kanban in Our Theatre & Dance AV Workflows</h1>
        <p>Scrum and Kanban are flexible project management methods that excel in organizing and optimizing workflows. While Scrum is often used in software development, both it and Kanban can greatly enhance our audio-visual (AV) needs in theatre and dance productions. Here’s how integrating these methodologies can streamline our work, whether it's setting up lighting, sound, or video.</p>
        
        <h2>How Scrum Fits into Our AV Work</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Product Owner:</strong> In our productions, the director or choreographer serves as the product owner. They define the creative vision and prioritize AV tasks—such as lighting cues or video projections—to enhance the performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Scrum Master:</strong> The technical director or stage manager acts as the Scrum Master. They ensure smooth operation, address obstacles, and keep the AV team focused on their goals.</li>
            <li><strong>Development Team:</strong> Our AV team—comprising sound, lighting, and video techs—is responsible for implementing the technical aspects of the show. They collaborate to set up and refine lighting, sound, and video elements through rehearsals.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Scrum Events for Our AV Workflow</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sprint:</strong> Each rehearsal period or tech week functions as a sprint, lasting one to two weeks. During this time, the AV team concentrates on completing key tasks such as setting up lighting or synchronizing sound with the performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Sprint Planning:</strong> Before rehearsals, the AV team meets with the director or choreographer to plan the technical elements needed, whether programming lighting cues or setting up audio.</li>
            <li><strong>Daily Stand-up:</strong> A brief daily meeting before rehearsal ensures alignment. The AV team discusses progress, any challenges, and prepares for the day's work.</li>
            <li><strong>Sprint Review & Retrospective:</strong> After a rehearsal phase, the AV team reviews what worked well and what needs improvement. This feedback helps refine the technical setup and ensures readiness for the performance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How Kanban Fits into Our AV Work</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Kanban Board:</strong> A Kanban board visualizes the flow of tasks from start to finish. For our AV team, this could mean tracking tasks like lighting setup, sound calibration, and video integration.</li>
            <li><strong>Work In Progress (WIP) Limits:</strong> By setting WIP limits, we ensure that the team focuses on completing tasks before starting new ones, preventing overload and maintaining quality.</li>
            <li><strong>Continuous Flow:</strong> Kanban emphasizes a steady flow of work, allowing for ongoing adjustments as technical needs and creative ideas evolve. This helps us adapt to changes quickly without the need for formal sprint cycles.</li>
            <li><strong>Pull System:</strong> Team members pull tasks from the backlog as they complete current work, allowing for a flexible, demand-driven approach. This helps the AV team stay responsive to the director’s needs and the performance’s requirements.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why Use Scrum and Kanban in Our AV Workflow?</h2>
        <div class="highlight">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Both methodologies allow us to adapt to changing creative ideas and technical needs during rehearsals. Scrum provides structured sprints for focused work, while Kanban offers continuous flexibility.</li>
                <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> By integrating Scrum and Kanban, our AV team works closely with the director, choreographer, and each other. This ensures that technical setups align with the artistic vision and supports smooth collaboration.</li>
                <li><strong>Problem-Solving:</strong> Regular Scrum check-ins and Kanban's visual workflow help us identify and address issues quickly. This prevents delays and ensures that everything is in place for opening night.</li>
            </ul>
