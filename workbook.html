    <title>Introduction to The TDAV Workbook</title>
        <h2>Welcome to The TDAV Workbook!</h2>
        <p>In an effort to streamline our task management and improve communication, we've implemented a new system using Google Sheets. This will help us stay organized and minimize the need for constant emails and texts.</p>

        <h2>Here’s how to use the workbook:</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Kanban Board</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> General task list.</li>
                    <li><strong>Action:</strong> Check for new tasks assigned to you when you clock in for shop hours.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Scrum Board</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Production task list.</li>
                    <li><strong>Action:</strong> Use this for tracking tasks in progress during a theatre production (1-2 week sprints).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Inventory</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Track inventory tasks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Action:</strong> These tasks are lower priority and can be done once other tasks are complete.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Task Handling:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Crew Tasks:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Details:</strong> Require more than one person (e.g., lifting, moving equipment).</li>
                    <li><strong>Action:</strong> Follow our Safety Training Guidelines.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>“Anyone” Tasks:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Details:</strong> Do not require multiple people.</li>
                    <li><strong>Action:</strong> Complete these when other tasks are finished.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Using the Workbook:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Filters:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>You can filter tasks by due date or by the person assigned to organize information according to your preferences.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Status Updates:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Change task status from "not started" to "completed" when done.</li>
                    <li>Use "in progress" to indicate ongoing tasks.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="note">
            <p><strong>Additional Notes:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>You do not need to check the workbook outside of work hours. For AV emergencies, I will handle them and log the details afterward.</li>
                <li>This system is new, so don't worry about getting everything perfect right away. If you have any questions or suggestions, please let me know. We might transition to a more advanced platform in the future, but for now, let's make the most of Google Sheets.</li>
            </ul>
